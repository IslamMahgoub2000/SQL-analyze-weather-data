## i used noaa_gsod dataset to extract temperature,wind speed ,precipitation for stations La Guardia and JFK,for everyday in 2020
SELECT
  stn,

  date,

   IF(

        temp=9999.9,
        NULL,
        temp) AS temperature,

  
       IF(

        wdsp="999.9",
        NULL,
        CAST(wdsp AS Float64)) AS wind_speed,

 IF(

       prcp=99.99,
       0,
       prcp) AS precipitation
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod2020`
WHERE
  stn="725030" -- La Guardia

  OR stn="744860" -- JFK
ORDER BY
  date DESC,
  stn ASC
  ## after that i used a new dataset to get average temperature and average wind speed
  ## average temperature in june
  SELECT

AVG(temperature)

FROM

`islam-datw.demos.weather_data` 

WHERE

date BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30'

## average wind speed in december
select
AVG(wind_speed)
  FROM

`islam-datw.demos.weather_data` 

WHERE

date BETWEEN '2020-12-01' AND '2020-12-31'
